# Stealth and Combat Tweaks

## Summary

A collection of tweaks to game settings that increase the difficulty and realism of stealth and combat. I'm releasing this as I was practicing with using Spriggit to go from ESM to Yaml and storing that in git. These are just the settings that I use for my game.

## Contributing

You need [Spriggit](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit) to convert from ESM to Yaml and back. Feel free to fork it and submit a pull request to introduce changes to game settings. You can also submit issues if something should be changed. Github actions are set up to build a nightly release and a release on tags. Go easy on me, I suck at git and DevOps and I'm just doing this to learn more.
